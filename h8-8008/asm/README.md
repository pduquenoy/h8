8008 Assembly Stuff
Scott Baker, https://www.smbaker.com/

It's been a while since I've done this... my notes below...

To assemble, you probably need the AS assembler by Alfred Arnold. You can
find this at http://john.ccac.rwth-aachen.de:8000/as/. My build machine is
a Linux VM running Ubuntu 20.04.

I build as from source by downloading
http://john.ccac.rwth-aachen.de:8000/ftp/as/source/c_version/asl-current.tar.bz2
. The Changelog from my checkout was dated 2023-07-10 and was 1.42 bld 247.
